# Duck Hunt

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create the iconic Duck Hunt game using the Nexys A7 board and a VGA monitor. The player navigates a reticle ball on the screen using the BTNU, BTNR, BTND, and BTNL buttons for horizontal and vertical movement. One or two duck balls move around the screen depending on which mode the player chooses. The player can decide whihc mode to play by flipping the _ switch for one duck or the _ switch for two ducks. When the player moves the reticle over the duck and presses the BTNC button, the duck is shot and the players get points. After a few seconds, the duck will respawn with faster movement.
